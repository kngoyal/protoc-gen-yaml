# Support
Only supports the requirements asked for in the README.md for messages and services.
Does not support Enums, Comments, GONames, et al.

# Assumption
There are no discrepancies (syntax+semantic) in the input `.proto` file.

# Unzip `protoc-gen-yaml.tar.gz` file inside directory $GOPATH/src/github.com
in my case this is ~/go/src/github.com

# Build
Run `go build` inside `protoc-gen-yaml` directory

# Update PATH
export PATH=$PATH:$(PATH_TO_protoc-gen-yaml)
in my case this is
export PATH=$PATH:~/go/src/github.com/protoc-gen-yaml

# Run protoc yaml plugin inside `protoc-gen-yaml` directory
mkdir output
time protoc -I test/input test/input/proto/echo.proto --yaml_out=./output
sequential > 0.00s user 0.00s system 81% cpu 0.010 total
concurrent > 0.00s user 0.00s system 88% cpu 0.009 total (variable)

# Check the output
diff ./output/proto/echo.proto.yaml ./test/output/proto/echo.proto.yaml

# Enhancements
Concurrently generate message and service methods and synchronize the output update.
Might change the order of expected output of the example in the test.

Robust Error Handling based on custom error messages from the protogen package.

# Nested Messages Test Case
time protoc -I test/input test/input/proto/echo-nested.proto --yaml_out=./output

concurrent > 0.01s user 0.00s system 73% cpu 0.014 total (variable)
