# Support
Only supports the requirements asked for in the README.md for messages and services.
Does not support Enums, Comments, GONames, et al.

# Assumption
There are no discrepancies (syntax+semantic) in the input `.proto` file.

# Build
Run `go build` inside `protoc-gen-yaml` directory

# Update PATH
export PATH=$PATH:$(PATH_TO_protoc-gen-yaml)
in my case this is
export PATH=$PATH:~/go/src/github.com/protoc-gen-yaml

# Run protoc yaml plugin inside `protoc-gen-yaml` directory
mkdir output
protoc -I test/input test/input/proto/echo.proto --yaml_out=./output

# Check the output
diff ./output/proto/echo.proto.yaml ./test/output/proto/echo.proto.yaml

# Enhancements
Concurrently generate message and service methods and synchronize the output update.
Might change the order of expected output of the example in the test.
